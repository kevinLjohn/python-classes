1. My progarm is about customizing a character of  your own. The problem im trying to solve is people having creativity blocks. 

2. My progarm is going to give the "player" endless customization.They'll be able to choose the pants, shirts, etc of the avatar. It'll let them choose what goes on the character.It'll allow them to add hats and glasses, anything they type onto the character.

3.The are a few progarms like mine, they appear in most games, like sonic forces, most rpg games and minecraft.

4.My project is a character customizer. The starting code will consist of a input commands and functions.
