# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is
 "reusable code instructions"
# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
 "the difference between the two is that the parameters are what it can go to and the arguments are what stops/control it's movements"
# a functions paramters are what it's allowed to do and the arguments are what they're not allowed to do.
# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments
def welcome():
   print(welcome)
# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmatic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
def Hyp():
  |   print(input("3x "))
|   print(input("3+ "))
|   print(input("3- "))
# 5. Write a function that will output a message to a user, telling them
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.
def class():
   print("You have to go to world history next")
