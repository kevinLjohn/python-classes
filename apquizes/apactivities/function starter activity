# 1. In your own words, describe what a function is
 "reusable code instructions"
# 2. What is are function parameters and arguments and describe
 "the difference between the two is that the parameters are placeholders while arguments are the data used
# a functions paramters are what it's allowed to do and the arguments are what they're not allowed to do.
# 3. write a function that will print out a welcome message
# that includes a users name. You will need to use parameters and arguments
def welcome(greeting):
   name = input("what is your name")
   print("Welcome " + name))
# 4. Write a function that will do a calculation that takes 3 parameters.
# Your function can do any of the arithmatic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
def calculation():
  number = input("input a number ")
  print(3* number)
  print(3+ number)
  print(3- number)
# what class they have next after this one. this code should use a 
# variable to pass a value into the parameter of a function. The variable should
# be real, user data- not hard coded data.
def class():
   print("You have to go to world history next")
