# 1. What is the difference between 
# a parameter and an argument in a python function
"The parameter is a placeholder and the argument is the code used"
# 2. In your own words, describe what 
# a conditional statement (if/else) is 
"A if/else statement is a function"
# 3. write a simple conditional state using a comparision operator(greater than, less than, etc. )
goop = input("input an number ")
 if (goop = 10):
 print("The nuber you choose is equip to the true number")
else
   (print("Your number is less than or greater than the true number")
     
# 3. Write a conditional statement for food in the refridgerator.
# your conditional statement should be wrapped in a function that takes one (1)
# parameter. The data type for this parameter should be true or false. 
# your function should have a line of code that asks the user if there is food in the refridgerator.
# If there is food in the refridgerator, print time to cook. If there is 
# NOT food in the fridge, print time to shop. 
# When you call your function there should be an argument that accepts 
# a boolean.

Food = input("is there food ")



if food = "yes":
   print("time to cook") 

else food == False
   print("time to shop")   

# 4. Create a function that checks the inventory of cereal for a store. 
# your function should parameter should accept an integer. In your function
# use a conditional statement to determine if you need to order more cereal.
# If there is more than 10 boxes, print "inventory full", else if there are less than 
# 10 boxes print "we need to order more cereal".
