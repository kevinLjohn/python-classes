# Create while loops for the following conditions


# 1. Create a security camera program that uses a while loop to detect if there is an
# object in site. 
camera4b = input("Is there anything on camera 4B? ")

while camera4b = 'yes'
    print("object spotted")
    cam4b = input("Is it still there? ")
    break

while cam4b = 'yes'
    print("object spotted")
    print(cam4b)
    break

while camera4b = 'no'
    print('good')
    break

while cam4b = 'no'
    print('good')
    break
# 2. Create a Printer Loop program that will continue to print copies of a document based on the number
# that the user inputs. 
count= int(input('how many cpoys do you want? '))

while count >= 0
    print('copy made')
    count += 1
    break
# 3. Create a Stop Light Loop that will change the light color based on different time intervals. 
# every 30 seconds the light should change between green and red. 

light = 1


while light < 30
    print('green light')
    light += 1
    break

while light > 60
    print('red light')
    light -= 1
    break


# 3. BONUS: add an additional condition that will change the light to yellow for 5 seconds before the
# next light change.
